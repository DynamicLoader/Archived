# Personal Archived Repository

The repository contained some previous repositories created/forked and modified by me.

## How do I save repositories

Each previous repository is saved in a separated directory named by `{Name}-{Type}-{AchievedDate}`.

Each directory contains one `.zip` and one `.tar.gz` files which contained the whole repository including `.git` directory.

Everyone who is interested in it can download it and extract to a local directory,and then use git to view its history.

## About License
Each archived repository is licensed by the license file in it.
Different repository may be licensed by different license.
