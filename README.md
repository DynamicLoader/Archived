# Personal Archived Repository

The repository contained some previous repositories created/forked and modified by me.

## How do I save repositories

Each previous repository is saved in a separated directory named by `{Name}-{Type}-{AchievedDate}`.

Each directory contains one `.zip` and one `.tar.gz` files which contained the whole repository including `.git` directory.

**Update @ 03/13/2023: To reduce file size, the compressed packages only contain the raw `.git` directory and a `git reset` is needed to be executed when restoring the files. Only affect the archives created after this day.** 

Everyone who is interested in it can download it and extract to a local directory,and then use git to view its history.

## About License
Each archived repository is licensed by the license file in it.
Different repository may be licensed by different license.
